            <p>Welcome to my DCDA Skills Portfolio!</p>
            <p>This site is a growing collection of projects from the semester that highlight my work in digital culture, data analytics, and web design. Each page represents a different lab assignment.
           By the end of the course, I hope this portfolio reflects my ability to combine technical skills, creative storytelling, and real-world interests like sustainability and visual communication.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- TODO: Replace this placeholder content with information about yourself -->
             
            <p><strong>Who I am:</strong> I am a senior at Texas Christian University majoring in Environmental & Sustainability Sciences and Digital Culture & Data Analytics, with a minor in General Business. I am originally from Houston, Texas and will be graduating in May 2026.</p>
            <p><strong>My interests:</strong> I am passionate about sustainability, travel, fashion, and digital media, and I am especially interested in how culture and technology influence consumer behavior and everyday decision-making. Outside of academics, I enjoy needlepointing, listening to podcasts, and exploring visual design, which has drawn me to projects that blend creativity with storytelling. These interests are what initially attracted me to DCDA as a way to study culture through digital platforms and data.</p>
            <p><strong>What I hope to learn:</strong> Through DCDA, I want to strengthen my skills in web development, data visualization, and digital storytelling using tools like HTML, CSS, mapping platforms, and analytical frameworks. I am particularly interested in learning how to communicate complex information clearly through visuals and interactive design, and how to present data in ways that are both meaningful and engaging.</p>

            <h2>Semester Reflection</h2>
            <!-- TODO: After completing all labs, write a reflection on your growth -->
            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> I learned how to set up a personal portfolio using GitHub, VS Code, and GitHub Pages, and how these tools work together to publish a website. I also became more comfortable editing HTML and understanding how small changes in code affect the structure and content of a webpage.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> One challenge I faced was uploading my profile photo and adjusting its size so it fit properly within the page layout, but through troubleshooting file paths and experimenting with CSS styling, I was able to resolve the issue and improve the overall design. </p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> My understanding of digital culture and data analytics has evolved as I've learned to use tools like Tableau and Folium to visualize data and tell stories with numbers. I've also become more confident in my ability to create and maintain a professional online presence.</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> I plan to continue building on these skills by exploring more advanced data visualization techniques and learning how to integrate interactive elements into web pages.</p>
