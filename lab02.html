        <section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In this lab, I evaluated two AI tools—Canva AI and ChatGPT—using a framework focused on capabilities, appropriate use, and ethical considerations...</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Tool 1: Canva AI</h2>
     <p>
    I tested Canva AI’s design capabilities using accessibility-focused prompts to see how well it handles
    WCAG readability/contrast guidance, inclusive palettes, and more complex accessibility constraints.
    I documented each prompt, Canva’s output, and what the result suggests about the tool’s strengths and limits.

            <h2>Semester Reflection</h2>
            <!-- TODO: After completing all labs, write a reflection on your growth -->
            <p><strong>What I learned:</strong> I learned how to set up a personal portfolio using GitHub, VS Code, and GitHub Pages, and how these tools work together to publish a website. I also became more comfortable editing HTML and understanding how small changes in code affect the structure and content of a webpage.</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges I overcame:</strong> One challenge I faced was uploading my profile photo and adjusting its size so it fit properly within the page layout, but through troubleshooting file paths and experimenting with CSS styling, I was able to resolve the issue and improve the overall design. </p>
            <p><strong>How I grew:</strong> My understanding of digital culture and data analytics has evolved as I've learned to use tools like Tableau and Folium to visualize data and tell stories with numbers. I've also become more confident in my ability to create and maintain a professional online presence.</p>
            <p><strong>Looking ahead:</strong> I plan to continue building on these skills by exploring more advanced data visualization techniques and learning how to integrate interactive elements into web pages.</p>
