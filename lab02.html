        <section>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>In this lab, I evaluated two AI tools—Canva AI and Claude—using a framework focused on capabilities, appropriate use, and ethical considerations...</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Tool 1: Canva AI</h2>
     <p>
    I tested Canva AI’s design capabilities using accessibility-focused prompts to see how well it handles
    WCAG readability/contrast guidance, inclusive palettes, and more complex accessibility constraints.
    I documented each prompt, Canva’s output, and what the result suggests about the tool’s strengths and limits.
  </p>


  <h3>Evidence: Prompts + Outputs</h3>
  <!-- Prompt 1 card -->
 <div class="prompt-card">
    <h4>Prompt 1: WCAG Accessibility (Baseline)</h4>
    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “Design a social media post announcing a sustainability event that meets WCAG accessibility standards for color contrast and readability.”</p>
    
    <div class="image-row">
  <figure>
    <img src="images/Instagram Post - Join the Sustainability Movement.jpg"
         alt="First Canva AI WCAG-focused sustainability post">
    <figcaption>Initial Canva AI WCAG-focused output.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <figure>
    <img src="images/Sustainability Event Poster - Urban Park.jpg"
         alt="Second Canva AI WCAG-focused sustainability post">
    <figcaption>Alternate Canva AI WCAG-focused variation.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>
 <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong>
    Both outputs prioritize clean hierarchy and readable text, but accessibility is treated as a visual approximation rather than a verified standard.
  </p>
</div>


  <!-- Prompt 2 card -->
  <div class="prompt-card">
    <h4>Prompt 2: Color-blind Friendly + Low Vision + Alt Text</h4>
    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “Can you use a color-blind friendly palette, readable hierarchy for low vision, and alt-text suggestions?”</p>
  <div class="single-image">
  <figure>
    <img src="images/Instagram Post - Join Our Sustainability Event!.jpg"
         alt="Canva AI redesign using a color-blind friendly palette and clearer hierarchy for low vision.">
    <figcaption>Revised output: improved hierarchy and simplified layout, but some light text on pale backgrounds may still fail contrast standards.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  </div>
    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Canva responds well to accessibility language, but may introduce new contrast issues—suggesting accessibility is treated as an aesthetic adjustment, not a measurable standard.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Prompt 3 card -->
 <div class="prompt-card">
    <h4>Prompt 3: WCAG AA Contrast Verification (Claims vs Proof)</h4>
    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “Redesign this post so that all text meets WCAG AA contrast ratios. Please specify which text/background combinations meet the standard.”</p>
    <div class="single-image"></div>
    <figure>
      <img src="images/Instagram Post - Sustainable Solutions for Tomorrow  .jpg" alt="Canva AI redesign with darker background and higher contrast text for WCAG AA." />
      <figcaption>
        Higher-contrast redesign: visually improved readability, but no contrast values or verification were provided despite the prompt.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
 </div>
    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Canva can redesign toward accessibility, but it does not audit or confirm WCAG AA compliance—verification still requires external checking and human review.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Prompt 4 card -->

  <div class="prompt-card">
    <h4>Prompt 4: Motion + Cognitive Accessibility (Limit Test)</h4>
    <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> “Create a short animated version of this post that is accessible for users with cognitive disabilities and motion sensitivity.”</p>
      <figcaption>
        Capability boundary: Canva AI stated it cannot reliably add text to videos and suggested adding text manually after generation.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> When accessibility constraints become multi-layered (motion sensitivity + cognition + text timing), Canva AI cannot fully execute the task and shifts responsibility back to the user.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Capabilities</h3>
  <p>
    Across the four tests, Canva AI was strongest at quickly producing polished layouts with clear hierarchy and a cohesive
    visual style. It responded to accessibility-oriented prompting by simplifying structure and increasing contrast in later
    iterations. However, the tool struggled with technical specificity: it did not provide measurable WCAG contrast proof,
    and it hit a clear limitation when asked to generate motion-accessible video that includes text. Overall, Canva AI
    behaves like a fast design assistant rather than an accessibility-aware system.
  </p>


  <h3>Appropriate Use</h3>
   <p>
    Canva AI is best used for early-stage drafting—quickly exploring layouts, visual directions, and accessibility-informed
    starting points. It becomes less appropriate when a project requires verified standards (WCAG AA compliance), nuanced
    accessibility needs (motion sensitivity), or accurate documentation of compliance. The most responsible workflow is:
    generate a draft with Canva AI, then refine intentionally and validate accessibility using external tools and human judgment.
  </p>

  <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
  <p>
    The biggest ethical risk I observed is “confidence without verification.” Canva AI can present outputs as accessible,
    but it does not reliably confirm compliance or provide evidence (contrast ratios, verified pairings). In public-facing or
    institutional communication, this can create a false sense of inclusion. Accessibility is not just a visual style—it
    affects who can participate. These tests reinforced that designers must take responsibility for validation and avoid
    treating AI-generated accessibility as automatically correct.

    <h2>Tool 2: Claude</h2>
  <p>
    To complement my evaluation of Canva AI’s visual design capabilities,
    I tested Claude as a text-based AI assistant with a focus on accessibility,
    ethical reasoning, and transparency.
